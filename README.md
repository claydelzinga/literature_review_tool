Hello, this is a literature review tool that can be used with a .csv file with the contents of authors, title, year publsihed and abstract in the file. 
All of this content can be downloaded in csv formatting using the tool Scopus which allows for search queries of papers using keywords and other filters.

Some notes about this file for the PRE team:

This tool requires an API key from OpenAI which you can use to call the GPT model. The cost of this, if you are using the GPT 4-o mini, is so small you can run 100+ papers for <0.01 USD (The GPT 4 model is a bit more expensive than this). On average the application takes 3 minutes 30 seconds/100 papers (Average speed per 100 papers abstracts).
